django-betterforms
------------------
`django-betterforms` builds on the built-in django forms.

Forked from https://github.com/fusionbox/django-betterforms
https://django-betterforms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Then updated for python3 and django 4.0

Multiforms fixed to work in 2022. The rest of the project(including forms, tests, views) may or may not work.
